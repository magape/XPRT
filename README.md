# XPRT

## What is XPRT
<p>XPRT is a small 3D printed object which helps you to disconnect the JST XH and PH connectors. XPRT is an acronym for XH & PH Removing Tool.</p>

## Why I designed XPRT
<p>When I introduced the micro:bit development board to my elementary school students, I found that none of them could disconnect the JST PH battery connector from the board. So, I designed a removing tool for the PH connector.</p>
<p>Because we use the JST XH as battery connector for the Karel robotic platform (https://nonformal.ro/karel/ ), I also designed a removal tool for the XH connector.</p>
<p>During some testing the top of one removing tool broke and that's when I realized I could make a puller for both the XH and PH connectors. This is how XPRT came about, which we use for the uBot robotics platform (https://nonformal.ro/ubot/), which has both types of connectors: XH and PH.</p>
