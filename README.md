# XPRT

## What is XPRT
XPRT is a small 3D printed object which helps you to disconnect the JST XH and PH connectors. XPRT is an acronym for XH & PH Removing Tool.

## Why I designed XPRT
When I introduced the micro:bit development board to my elementary school students, I found that none of them could disconnect the JST PH battery connector from the board. So, I designed a removing tool for the PH connector.

Because we use the JST XH as battery connector for the [Karel robotic platform](https://nonformal.ro/karel), I also designed a removal tool for the XH connector.

During some testing the top of one removing tool broke and that's when I realized I could make a puller for both the XH and PH connectors. This is how XPRT came about, which we use for the [uBot robotics platform](https://nonformal.ro/ubot), which has both types of connectors: XH and PH.
